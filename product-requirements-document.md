## System Attributes
<b>Low Cost</b><br>
<i>I don't want to spend loads on this, it's only supposed to be a replacement for a Udacity course.</i><br><br><br>

<b>Large Growth Capacity</b><br>
<i>I want to be able to add things to it later on when I learn new technologies or have other ideas.</i><br><br><br>

<b>High Reliability</b><br>
<i>I don't want to have to be repairing it all the time.</i><br><br><br>

<b>High Durability</b><br>
<i>I don't want to have to be super careful when I'm around it. Since it's autonomous, it should be fairly robust to accidents, drops, things falling on it etc.</i><br><br><br>

<b>High Maintainability</b><br>
<i>If anything goes wrong, I want to be able to fix it fairly easily.</i><br><br><br>

<b>Exciting</b><br>
<i>I want to be able to show it off to people at interviews, to friends, and at work. It's got to be reasonably cool for that.</i><br><br><br>

## Functional Requirements
### Sense Environment
### Traverse Environment
<b>NFP:</b> The rover should be able to map a room with floor space 5m^2 by 5m^2 in one hour.<br>
<i>Since the rover is autonomous, it's not essential that it map quickly. As long as it doesn't take forever.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b><br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>

### Map Environment
<b>NFI:</b> The rover shall send it's internal map to a PC for visualisation.<br>
<i>I want to be able to see the map that it produces. The actual software to visualise the map needs to be written too, but that's a separate project.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b><br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>
