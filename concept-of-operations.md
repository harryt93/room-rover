# Room Rover Concept of Operations

## Scenario 1: Trodden on in the Dark

### Scenario
The rover is trundling around on the floor in the middle of the night. Person gets out of bed, and stands on the rover, breaking it.

### Derived Requirements:
The system shall not operate in darkness.
<i>If it's dark, assume that the person can't see either, it's probably night. Not operating at night is the easiest way to avoid being trodden on. </i>
