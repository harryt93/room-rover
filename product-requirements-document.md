## Non-Functional System Requirements
<b>NFS:</b> The total development cost must be less than £500.<br>
<i>This project is instead of a Udacity course, of which the average price is £500. Not willing to spend more than that.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b> At project completion, check that the total spent has been less than £500.<br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>

## Functional Requirements
### Sense Environment
### Traverse Environment
<b>NFP:</b> The rover should be able to map a room with floor space 5m^2 by 5m^2 in one hour.<br>
<i>Since the rover is autonomous, it's not essential that it map quickly. As long as it doesn't take forever.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b><br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>

### Map Environment
<b>NFI:</b> The rover shall send it's internal map to a PC for visualisation.<br>
<i>I want to be able to see the map that it produces. The actual software to visualise the map needs to be written too, but that's a separate project.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b><br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>

### Manage Rover
