## Non-Functional System Requirements
<b>NFS_01:</b> The total development cost must be less than £500.<br>
<i>This project is instead of a Udacity course, of which the average price is £500. Not willing to spend more than that.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b> At project completion, check that the total spent has been less than £500.<br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>

## Functional Requirements
### Traverse Environment
<b>NFP_01:</b> The rover should be able to map a room with floor space 5m^2 by 5m^2 in one hour.<br>
<i>Since the rover is autonomous, it's not essential that it map quickly. As long as it doesn't take forever.</i><br><br>
<b>Verification Activity:</b><br>
<b>Verification Outcome:</b>
